log-malloc-simple
=================

*log-malloc-simple* is **pre-loadable** library tracking all  memory allocations of a program. It produces simple text trace output, that makes it easy to find leaks and also identify their origin.

The output of *log-malloc-simple* can be easily parsed by a log analyzer tool. A simple log-analyzer written in Java is also part of this package.

## Changes compared to log-malloc2

log-malloc-simple is a much simplified version of log-malloc2. The simplifications and their reason:

- The return value of all allocations is returned intact. This prevents some crashes that were caused by log-malloc2 due to lack of memory alignment returned by modified calloc method.
- Only malloc_usable_size() is used to track the size of allocated memory.
- Conditional compilation is removed. I have no chance to test all versions of the code. Only platforms with GNU backtrace and malloc_usable_size are supported.
- Data aggregation of the logger is removed. It is delegated to a separate log-analyzer tool.

## Features

- logging to file descriptor 1022 (if opened)
- call stack **backtrace** (using GNU backtrace())
- thread safe

## Dependencies

- malloc_usable_size() method - could be get rid of but we could not track the size of freed memory chunks. In case we analyze all the logs of the whole lifecycle of the program then it could be accepted.
- pthread - for synchronizing logs from different threads.
- /proc/self/exe, /proc/self/cwd

## Usage

`LD_PRELOAD=./liblog-malloc-simple.so command args ... 1022>/tmp/program.log`

### Log analyzer tool

Standalone program written in Java. Usage:

- Create a pipe that will transfer memory allocation log to the Java program: `$ mkfifo /tmp/malloc.pipe`
- Start analyzer: `$ java -jar analyzer.jar /tmp/malloc.pipe`
- Use console to command analyzer: stop/start collecting data, print or save current state to file
- Start program to analyze: `$ LD_PRELOAD=./liblog-malloc-simple.so my_executable args ... 1022>/tmp/malloc.pipe`
- Run test cases that should run without leaking memory.
- See the output of the analyzer for non-freed memory chunks.
- Log output may also be directed to a static file and analysed offline.
- Input of analyser may be redirected. This way it can be used in an automated process.

## Building instructions

### The maven way

```
git clone https://github.com/qgears/opensource-utils.git
git clone https://github.com/qgears/log-malloc-simple.git
cd log-malloc-simple
mvn package
```
The resulting, standalone jar, with all its dependencies packed in, will be located as follows:
`java/hu.qgears.analyzelogmalloc/target/analyzer.jar`

### Eclipse IDE
- The analyser is written in Java and stored as an Eclipse project. (The project uses OSGI for dependency management but must be run as a standalone Java program.)
- import the `hu.qgears.analyzelogmalloc` and `hu.qgears.commons` projects into an Eclipse workspace
 - hint: `hu.qgears.commons` dependency is located in the  https://github.com/qgears/opensource-utils repo
- create a Java app. run configuration for the `Analyze` class. Analyser may be used by launching inside Eclipse as a standalone applocation.
- export the run configuration as an executable jar
- TODO: implement MAVEN build

* Log stream begins with basic process information lines beginning with #
* #MAPS ...: content of /proc/self/maps
* Log entries start with a line beginning with '+' followed by an entry type name and two numbers (all separated by single space characters):
    * First is size in bytes as a decimal number
    * Second is memory address as a hexadecimal constant (eg. 0x1db9010)
end with a line beginning with '-'
* Log entry types are:
    * "INIT" - (size and address parameter is not important) means that the analyser tool is set up
    * "FINI" - (no size and address parameter) means that the process quit
    * "malloc", "calloc", "memalign", "posix_memalign", "valloc", "free": These methods have the same names in C
    * "realloc_free", "realloc_alloc": realloc calls result in two separate log entries one for free and one for allocation
* Allocation log entries contain stack trace where the allocation related method was called from
* Log entries are closed with a line starting with "-" character

## Analysed data output

Analyser waits for commands on stdin:

 * off - turn analyzer off while the application is setting up (to spare CPU cycles when analysation is not required - eg initialization of the program)
 * on - turn analyzer on when the critical session is started (default is on)
 * (reset - clear all log entries cached by the analyzer)
 * print - print current allocation status (since last reset/on) to stdout
 * save <filename> - print current allocation status (since last reset/on) to file

The analysed data output is in text format. After a short summary all not-freed allocations are listed. These entries are ordered and summarised by the identifier of the instruction (library+pointer) calling the allocation method. The textual output of the same program in different moments may be compared to each other using text comparing tools to find leaks. (A single call from each allocator calling instruction is printed as an example in the output but this does not mean that it is the only possible stack trace that calls this leaking method.):
